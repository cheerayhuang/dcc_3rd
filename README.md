# Vector cosine similarity calculation

## Build

```bash
$> mkdir build
$> cd build
$> cmake ../
$> make
```
After running these commands above, an executable file named `calc_cosim` will be generated by `cmake`.

## Usage

And you can use `./calc_cosim --help` to show how to execute the program. A brief usage is as follows:

<!--
|Flags| Describe | default |
|--|--|--|
|--dict |dictionary vectors file path | "dict_vec.csv"
|--seed |seed vectors file path | "seed_vec.csv"
|--round |the number of Round of the current execution | 1
-->

```
--seed 
	string, seed vectors file path. Default: "seed_vec.csv'.
--dict
    string, dictionary vectors file path. Default: "dict_vec.csv'.
--round
    int32, the number of Round of the current execution. Default: 1.
```

For instance,  `./calc_cosim --seed ./test/seed_vec.csv --dict ./test/dict_vec.csv --round 1` will run the program `1st round` with reading `seed_vec.csv` and `dict_vec.csv` in the directory `./test`.

`result.csv` and `duration.log` should be generated after running in current directory.
